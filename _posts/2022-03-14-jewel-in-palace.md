Not too many dramas I've watched over 50 episode; hell, over 30 episodes. But, watching this one was simply a privilege! It had been on my watch queue for a very long time and once in a awhile I get into these must watch historical drama moods! Lo and behold, 5 days later, I completed this drama and now I am simply in love with Ji Jin Hee!! 

This was my first drama watching him as well as Lee Yeong-Ae who seems to be quite famous in her time. The love story between their characters; Sir Min and Jang Geum is simply one of the most romantic stories I've ever seen! The chemistry, the portrayal of these characters by the actors was simply amazing!! Amazing! Amazing!! 

I loved the story, it helped peak my interesting in learning more about the art of food and healing. It truly was a well told story with beautiful cinematography! This is a 2003 drama so if you are new to dramas, it will seem very different than the more modern ones; however, after watching this tremendous jewel, I now know what the ratings during its broadcast times was well into the 50% range! Excellent! Excellent! Stupendous! I will never forget this love story ever!
